# Personal Goals Document - Traders@SMU Alpha Program

Level 2 (Associate)

## 1. Background in Quantitative Finance

I initially got interested in trading after hearing about it from a friend who traded foreign exchange pairs. I learned about various trading strategies and spent hours on the charts, before switching to futures and learning how to day trade those assets. After seeing some success, I knew I wanted to continue down this path. I had a strong background in Math, and decided to add a Math major along with my Finance one in college. I hoped that I could use math and data analytics to continue to evolve my knowledge of trading, making it more quantitative. Taking multivariable calculus and linear algebra helped with this tremendously. Now, I am eager to continue growing my quantitative finance knowledge in the Traders@SMU organization.

## 2. Career Goals

My main career goal in quantitative finance is to be a quantitative trader. I want to be applying different algorithms on the charts and execute trades, as well as work with developers to develop trading strategies. I am also interested in being a derivatives trader. I want to work at firms like 2sigma, Point72, Citadel, Renaissance, and other hedge funds. I am also interested in high frequency trading. These positions are of great interest to me and I hope to be trading derivatives or equities at these firms in the future. I want to start my career as a trader, but eventually I want to generate enough capital to open my own firm with my own unique strategy in the long term. It has always been my dream to run my own fund.

## 3. What I Hope to Learn from This Program

I believe that the Alpha Program will holistically grow my quantitative finance skills, but specifically I am eager to improve my programming abilities, my problem solving skills, and I also want a place to apply my math and statistics skills at a high level, leveraging computer science. I also want to develop new trading strategies, including ways to hedge my positions and other advanced strategies to take my trading to the next level. Beyond this, I hope the Alpha Program will allow me to meet industry professionals and hear first-hand experiences about the quant industry, giving me the background I need to succeed in it myself. 

## 4. Current Technical Skills

Some of my advanced technical skills include market analysis and understanding trends, financial modeling, mathematical applications, trading strategies, and statistical analysis. My intermediate skills include data analysis. The areas in which I am a beginner but eager to grow are various programming languages, machine learning, and version control. 

## 5. Development Plan & Program Goals

I want to use Traders@SMU and the Alpha Program to develop my quantitative finance skills, specifically leveraging computer science and programming to create algorithms that take my trading strategies and amplify it in a more consistent manner. I believe that I can see my progress by measuring how my coding skills develop but also apply my knowledge and slowly try and develop my own model and test it to see if I am profitable. To reach my goals, I am willing to devote as much time as needed, because I understand that success only happens if you do what needs to be done, and if that requires hours a day then that is what is needed. Part of that means continuing to develop myself outside of the program, by enrolling in CS courses or keeping up to date with various market news, as well as training my math skills. For me, I will know if I am successful if I am working as a quantitative trader at a successful firm post-graduation, because then I will know that it all paid off.
